# 🔥 DIY Arc Gas Lighter Using TP4056 and High Voltage
A simple, low-cost, and eco-friendly DIY project to build a rechargeable electric arc gas lighter using a TP4056 charging module, an 18650 Li-ion battery, and a high-voltage inverter circuit. This device generates a high-voltage arc that can ignite gas instantly—ideal for home or outdoor use.

## 📌 Objective
Design and construct a compact, rechargeable arc lighter that replaces traditional gas lighters with an efficient, reusable solution.

## 🧰 Components Used
- TP4056 Charging Module (with overcharge/overdischarge protection)
- 18650 Li-ion Battery
- High Voltage Inverter Circuit (~4000V output)
- Push Button Switch
- Wires & Connectors
- Insulating Materials / Protective Casing

## 🔧 Working Principle
1. The TP4056 module charges the 18650 battery via USB.
2. When the button is pressed, battery power is supplied to the high-voltage inverter.
3. The inverter steps up the 3.7V battery output to around 4,000V, producing a visible arc.
4. The arc is strong enough to ignite gas instantly.

## ⚠️ Safety Precautions
- Fully insulate all high-voltage parts.
- Do not operate near flammable materials.
- Never touch the arc during operation.
- Use heat-shrink tubing or plastic casing to avoid shorts.

## 🎯 Applications
- Kitchen gas lighters
- Portable igniters for camping, BBQ, etc.

## ✅ Advantages
- Rechargeable and reusable
- Eco-friendly (no fuel required)
- Low-cost and easy to build
- Safer than open-flame lighters (when properly insulated)

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Requires regular battery charging
- Performance may degrade in windy conditions
- Arc strength depends on battery charge level
